# Body-Rocking Behavior Recognition

### Description
Wearable sensors have been shown to be effective for promoting self-awareness, wellness and re-education. For this project, you
will develop a detector for Body-rocking behavior from a blind subject (also commonly observed in individuals with autism) using
inertial measurements from a wearable system. Two sensors, one of the wrist and another on the arm were used to record motion using accelerometers and gyroscopes. The data will consists of sessions about 1-2 hours long each with
annotations of when the behavior was observed. The goal is to train a classifier for the detections of these events.

The consolidated data from all the sessions can be found [here](Training_Data_B/AllData/)
